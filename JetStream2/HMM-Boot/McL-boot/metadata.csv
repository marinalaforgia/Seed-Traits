McL_seed-traits.csv,chem.mass.mg,numerical,mg,mass of 100 seeds in mg (does not include appendages except in asters where the fruit coat (achene) would be too difficult to remove
McL_seed-traits.csv,set.time.mpsec,numerical,m/s,settling time (falling speed) in meters per second

McL_seed-traits.csv,height.cm,numerical,cm,"plant height, used as a proxy for seed release height and used to categorize dispersal categories, comes either from individual datasets (McLaughlin, Carrizo, Jasper Ridge etc) or from literature"
McL_seed-traits.csv,shape,numerical,NA,"unitless number describing the shape of the seed, includes persistent appendages, varies from 0 (round) to 0.2 (needle like)"
McL_seed-traits.csv,size.mm,numerical,mm,"Length in mm of the longest seed axis, includes persistent appendages only"
McL_seed-traits.csv,coat.perm.perc,numerical,mg/mg*100,Seed coat permeability percentage: (mass of soaked seeds - mass of dry seeds)/mass of dry seed

McL_seed-traits.csv,fruit.thick,numerical,mm,fruit coat thickness (mm)
McL_seed-traits.csv,both.thick,numerical,mm,fruit + seed coat thickness - this might be the most reliable as it was consistently difficult to measure the true seed coat in achenes
McL_seed-traits.csv,coat.thick.per.width,numerical,ratio,both.thick/seed width
McL_seed-traits.csv,wing.loading,numerical,mg/mm2,morph.mass.mg/area.mm2; indicates how mass is spread out over the seed; lower values indicate higher potential for wind dispersal
